Introduction
============

Ciphergeard is a small package which implements some famous ancient ciphers in Python.
The name '**Ciphergeard**' is made up of 2 words - '**Cipher**' and '**geard**'.
**Geard** is the old English word for '**garden**'. So **Ciphergeard** is basically '**Cipher Garden**'.

I just randomly thought about using the word 'garden' and stuck with it.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: shell
    
   pip install ciphergeard
